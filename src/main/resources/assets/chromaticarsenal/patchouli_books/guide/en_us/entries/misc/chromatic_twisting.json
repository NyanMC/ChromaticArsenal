This curse, when applied to any chromatic curio that supports it, will add a harmful side-effect to the curio. At the same time, however, the curio will be granted a beneficial secondary ability. The effects of Chromatic Twisting on a given curio are listed on that curio's guidebook page. This curse can be sold by Librarians."
