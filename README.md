# Chromatic Arsenal

This is the Chromatic Arsenal source.

If you're here to view the source, most items are stored in the items package. If an item isn't there (e.g. the ward crystal), it is likely created by directly extending the BaseCurioItem class. A majority of the trinket effects that aren't tick based are handled inside EventClassInstance (and I know, it's a mess in there).
