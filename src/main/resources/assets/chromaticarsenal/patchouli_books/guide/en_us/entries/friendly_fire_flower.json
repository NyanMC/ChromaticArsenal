      "text": "The Friendly Fire Flower causes damage you deal to yourself (e.g. hitting yourself with your own arrows) to be negated for free. Being set on fire will also grant fire resistance at the cost of durability, however this takes a second to activate (it won't save you from the inital burn). This item has very little durability, and therefore it is encouraged to apply Unbreaking and Mending to it as soon as possible."
